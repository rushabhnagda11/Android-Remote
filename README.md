Android-Remote
==============

An app that let's you control your computer's mouse and keyboard actions from your android device

Run the server2.jar on your computer. If you're on a Windows Machine then open a Command Prompt with Administrator priveleges.

Firstly, both you and the android device have to be connected to the same wifi network.
Now open up your laptop/computer, and find your local ip address. Type ipconfig on a Linux machine or ifconfig on a Windows machine. Find out your local ip, something on the lines of 192.168.xxx.xxx

Now open the app on your device, type the ip and presto! May you be blown away by the awesomeness of the terrible code that I've written.
